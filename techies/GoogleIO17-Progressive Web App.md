# Progressive Web Apps - Google I/O 17

## Why we have to make PWA?
webpages have a lot more view than native apps,  
but they are not giving users pleasant experience,  
so the hours users stay in web vs native apps,  
latter absolutely dominates.  
  
So what if webs give a sweet experience like native apps,  
what could be better?
